# Whitespace don't matter

; Here are examples of how types are interpreted(no keywords are off limits!)
[special_values]
    int = 42
    float = 269.887
    truth = yes
    falsehood = no
    true = true
    ; I don't encourage this but it's valid ;)
    false = FaLSe

    # Null value
    nah = Null
